# 🧩 Cheating at Scrabble 🏆

## 📌 Overview
A Python program analyzing user-inputted Scrabble racks to generate all possible valid words, calculate their scores, and rank them. Utilizes:
- **Modular programming** by creating and importing Python modules.
- **Wildcard handling** for flexibility.
- **Adherence to PEP 8** coding standards.

## 🗂 Files & Notebooks
| File | Description |
|------|------------|
| `scrabble_nb.ipynb` | Jupyter Notebook for testing and debugging Scrabble word scoring |
| `scrabble.py` | Main script implementing Scrabble word scoring based on letter values |
| `wordscore.py` | Helper module containing scoring functions for word evaluation |
| `sowpods.txt` | Official SOWPODS word list for Scrabble word validation |



## 🔎 Problem Statement
The goal is to create a **Scrabble cheater algorithm** that takes up to 7 letters (with up to 2 wildcards) as input and returns its Scrabble score based on official tile values.

## 🛠 Methods & Implementation
- Implementing **dictionary-based** scoring for words.
- Handling **edge cases** (e.g., empty strings, invalid characters).
- Demonstrating **efficient algorithmic design** for wildcard handling.
- **Modularization:** Separating logic into `scrabble.py` and `wordscore.py` for reusability.

## 📊 Key Features
1. **Flexible Scoring:** Supports standard Scrabble rules & custom modifications.
2. **Optimized Performance:** Uses dictionary lookups instead of conditionals.
3. **Modular Design:** Functions are structured for easy reuse in other projects.
